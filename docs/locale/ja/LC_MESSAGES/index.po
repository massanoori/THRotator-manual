#: ../../index.rst:76
msgid ""
"Development of THRotator was initially inspired by Vertical Play "
"developed by `niisaka at Tari Lari Run <http://bygzam.seesaa.net/>`_, "
"which is the first screen rotation tool for Touhou Project to my best "
"knowledge. In fact, THRotator and Vertical Play share the way how a user "
"rotates a screen (alt+arrow keys)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:80
msgid ""
"But in terms of the following points, THRotator and Vertical Play are "
"different."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:83
msgid "Support on earlier works"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:85
msgid ""
"Vertical Play provides screen rotation functionality only to works "
"working on Direct3D 9 (Touhou 10 and later)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:87
msgid ""
"In addition to supporting works on Direct3D 9, THRotator also supports "
"works built upon Direct3D 8 (from Touhou 6 to 9.5)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:91
msgid "Future product support"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:93
msgid ""
"Although I haven't seen any specific implementation of Vertical Play, the"
" rearrangements of HUD elements seem hard coded. When a new title is "
"released, users must wait for implementation by the developer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:97
msgid ""
"THRotator allows users to configure how HUD elements are arranged. Users "
"can enjoy a new product immediately after its release with THRotator on "
"vertically-long screen."

msgid "How user's configuration is saved"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:104
msgid "Vertical Play saves user's configuration via registry keys on Windows."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:106

msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:111
msgid "Performance"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:113
msgid ""
"I haven't measured performance and seen implementation of Vertical Play. "
"But what Vertical Play does looks simply hacking transform matrix update "
"from Touhou Project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:116
msgid ""
"On the other hand, THRotator copies pixels from dummy back buffer, which "
"is undoubtedly more costly than just overwriting transform matrices."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:121
msgid "Neatness of rendering"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:123
msgid ""
"What THRotator does is just copying rects. Thus noticeable pixel "
"discontinuity appears near boundary of rects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:126
msgid ""
"Vertical Play results in much cleaner rendering since it overrides draw "
"calls with transparency. HUD elements and background is well blended with"
" Vertical Play."
